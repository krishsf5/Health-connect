# ✅ Complete Fixes Summary

## 🎯 **All Issues Fixed!**

---

## 1️⃣ **Doctor Registration Role Bug - FIXED** ✅

### **Problem:**
When registering as a doctor via `/doctor/login`, users were getting `role: "patient"` instead of `role: "doctor"`.

### **Root Cause:**
`DoctorLogin.jsx` was calling the wrong endpoint:
```javascript
// BEFORE (Wrong):
POST /api/auth/register  // This is the PATIENT registration endpoint!
```

### **Solution:**
Fixed `DoctorLogin.jsx` to call the correct endpoint:
```javascript
// AFTER (Correct):
POST /api/auth/register-doctor  // Dedicated doctor registration endpoint
```

### **What Changed:**
- **File:** `client/src/pages/DoctorLogin.jsx`
- **Line 107:** Changed endpoint from `'register'` to `'register-doctor'`
- **Added:** Console logging to track registration flow

---

## 2️⃣ **Doctor Registration Routes - FIXED** ✅

### **Problem:**
URL `/doctor-create` was redirecting to `/doctor/login`

### **Solution:**
Added `/doctor-create` as an alias route:

**Files Changed:**
1. **`client/src/App.jsx` (Line 68):**
   ```javascript
   // Allow both routes
   if (location.pathname === "/doctor/create" || location.pathname === "/doctor-create") return;
   ```

2. **`client/src/App.jsx` (Line 235):**
   ```javascript
   // Added alias route
   <Route path="/doctor-create" element={<DoctorCreate onLogin={setUser} />} />
   ```

**Now Both URLs Work:**
- ✅ `http://localhost:5173/doctor/create`
- ✅ `http://localhost:5173/doctor-create`

---

## 3️⃣ **Video Call Feature for Patients - ADDED** ✅

### **Problem:**
When a doctor starts a video call, patients had no way to join.

### **Solution:**
Added complete video calling functionality to Patient Dashboard!

### **What Was Added:**

#### **A. Join Call Button**
Patients now see a "Join Video Call" button in their current appointments when a doctor has created a meeting link:

```jsx
{a.meetingLink && (
  <button onClick={() => setOpenCall(a._id)}>
    <i data-lucide="video"></i>
    Join Video Call
  </button>
)}
```

#### **B. Jitsi Video Call Modal**
Full-screen video call modal with:
- ✅ Doctor name and appointment details
- ✅ Embedded Jitsi iframe
- ✅ Dark mode support
- ✅ Close button
- ✅ Professional UI

**Files Changed:**
- **`client/src/pages/PatientDashboard.jsx`:**
  - Added `openCall` state (Line 36)
  - Added "Join Video Call" button (Lines 561-583)
  - Added Jitsi video modal (Lines 634-683)

## 🎨 **How Video Calls Work:**

### **Patient Side:**
1. Patient sees "Join Video Call" button in their current appointments
2. Button only appears when doctor has created the meeting link
