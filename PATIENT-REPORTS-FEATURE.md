## Frontend Implementation

### Updated File: `client/src/pages/Reports.jsx`

**New Components Added:**
1. Upload button in header
2. Medical Reports section (above analytics)
3. Upload modal with form
4. Report viewer modal

**New State Variables:**
- `medicalReports` - Array of reports
- `showUploadModal` - Toggle upload modal
- `selectedReport` - Currently viewing report
- `uploadForm` - Upload form data
- `uploading` - Upload in progress flag

**New Functions:**
- `fetchMedicalReports()` - Load all reports
- `handleFileChange()` - Handle file selection
- `handleUpload()` - Convert to base64 and upload
- `viewReport()` - Fetch and display report
- `handleDeleteReport()` - Delete report

## File Storage
Reports are stored as **base64 encoded strings** in MongoDB. This approach:
- ✅ Works perfectly with serverless functions
- ✅ No need for separate file storage service
- ✅ Simple to implement and maintain
- ⚠️ Consider moving to cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary) for production if files are large

## Security Features
- ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- ✅ Users can only access their own reports
- ✅ File type validation (PDF, JPEG, PNG only)
- ✅ File size validation (10MB max)
- ✅ No public access to report data

## Usage Flow
